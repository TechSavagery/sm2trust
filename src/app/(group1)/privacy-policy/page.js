      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Scope</h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This Privacy Policy applies to personal information that Company
        receives during its business operations as a “data controller” - which
        means we determine the purpose and means of processing such personal
        information.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term “personal information”
        means any information that, alone or in conjunction with other
        information or data, identifies or is linked to a particular individual
        or household and that is subject to or otherwise afforded protection
        under a data protection law, statute, or regulation. The term “personal
        information” does not include anonymized or de-identified data that is
        not attributable to a particular individual or household and that is not
        otherwise subject to a data protection law, statute, or regulation.
        Company may anonymize or de-identify personal information, and such data
        is not subject to this Privacy Policy and Company may use such data for
        any purpose.
